# Search-Engine-Optimisation-and-Word-Search
In this project we implemented the technique of search
engine optimization in a complete different way. Here we first
asked the user to enter the word to be searched, then by using
the word recommendation process, we returned the possible
combinations from the set of the words present in our collection.
Then out of those returned words, user can search the file for any
one of them. Out of the created files, our program will return all
the files containing the entered word.

In white hat seo, what happens is that the entered word is
searched in all the pages having meta-content same to that word,
and as a result all the pages are returned to the user in
descending order of the number of appearance of the given word
in those pages.
In our program, the entered word is searched in the files and
the result contain all the files having the word, arranged in
descending order of the number of appearances of that word.
